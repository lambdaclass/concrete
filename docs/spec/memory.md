# Memory

This chapter is a stub. It holds the foundation decisions about the memory model, which the Core
semantics (R-0496) and the memory layer of the lower pipeline (R-0502) will define. The rest of
the area (what safe code may observe, heap cells, `Heap<T>`, allocation and freeing) migrates
here from MEMORY_MODEL, MEMORY_GUARANTEES and the remaining sections of MEMORY_SEMANTICS
(README §8).

## Rules

<a id="MEM-1"></a>
### MEM-1. Two-layer memory

**MEM-1@1.** Safe values live in allocations with identities, raw memory is CompCert's block-and-offset model of bytes and pointer fragments with permissions, and a representation relation connects the two layers.

- Kind: guarantee
- Uses: none
- Codes: none
- Status: pending R-0502
- Semantics: none
- Obligation: the typed-value and raw-memory abstraction lemma (R-0496, R-0502)
- Evidence: tested

**Rationale.** Safe code reasons about structured values and places. Raw operations and FFI need
bytes, offsets and pointer provenance. Keeping both layers, with one relation between them, lets
safe programs be verified without byte-level reasoning, while raw code still has an exact
semantics (VERIFIED_PIPELINE, "IR chain").

<a id="MEM-2"></a>
### MEM-2. Addresses are quasi-concrete

**MEM-2@1.** A block has no numeric address until a pointer into it is exposed, and exposing a pointer is an operation with a semantic effect, never an erasable cast.

- Kind: guarantee
- Uses: none
- Codes: none
- Status: pending R-0502
- Semantics: none
- Obligation: a finite-address-space policy stated with the memory model (R-0502)
- Evidence: tested

**Rationale.** Treating every address as concrete makes optimizations unsound, and treating every
address as abstract makes integer-pointer round trips undefined. With quasi-concrete addresses,
only exposed blocks have numeric addresses, so unexposed blocks keep their freedom (VERIFIED_PIPELINE,
"Language decisions this requires"). The surface operations are TRUST-1's.
