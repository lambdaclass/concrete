# Diagnostic rule registry

A diagnostic cites the Lean declaration that states its rule and that rule's own revision
(`RuleId`, defined in `Ident`). This is the complete registry declaration.
Later pieces register rules when their definitions and evidence land, importing their owning
modules here. An entry records identity, not approval or a second definition of the rule.

`scripts/spec/rules.sh` reads entries and documentation from the built Lean environment. It
requires a declared decision-row citation and separate elaborated accepted and refused proofs
for each entry. Example links use Lean declaration names, the identities used by the site.
